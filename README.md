# paths-tree-unist

I made this package, because I've seen a few solutions but none of them was universal enough. So this:
* uses [unist](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist) tree data structure (so you can use unist tools to traverse/modify it),
* a node can contain multiple segments of the path,
* allows to store custom data for any segment of the path,
* has advanced logic for opening/closing the folders.

So whether you are creating a simple tree representation, or VS Code's like advanced file browser this should help you a lot.
